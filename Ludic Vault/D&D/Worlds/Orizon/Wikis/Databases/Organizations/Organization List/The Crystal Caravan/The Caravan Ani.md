(also known as the The Mother Caravan, Crystal Caravan). The caravan from which all the other caravans supposedly originated, which are considered splinter caravans. This caravan is where all Crystal Elders (a title given only to the most skilled amongst the caravans) are trained and where most of them stay. Crystal Elders hold knowledge of all of the Caravans’ history and folklore, its traditions, and especially the secrets to finding, caring for, and tending to dragon eggs.

Giergenigoshesua’ahni, Elder Crystal Mother (Mother Geshi) - Dragon kin. 200?. She/They. “Eldest of the Crystal Elders, eldest of The Caravan Ani, Eldest of all the Crystal Caravans. They are said to have been there when Mangkukulam’s Fruit climbed from underneath the great mother-mountain-god. She is said to have witnessed Pagano Bansaland’s halcyon eras, and to hold the wisdom and knowledge that all of the land and all of its people and creatures possess.” In reality, this is not true. Though it isn’t a lie, either--it is simply the mythology which the Caravan holds around the role of Elder Crystal Mother. Certainly, Giergenigoshesua’ahni (colloquially called Mother Geshi by most) is wiser and more knowledgeable of the land and life than many many others. And she knows how to deal with the socio-political power she wields. Generous. She has an air of grace, ethereality, and other-worldliness about her. Her voice has a gently commanding quality to it, like a song that you do not want to turn away from hearing. Also, they makes terrible puns that everyone is afraid to react to because of her station (and she knows this, and perhaps has some enjoyment in watching people squirm, but would love for someone to just be honest and groan or laugh at the pun).

  

Jejenjeshui’ihihi (Elder Jeshu) - Dragon kin. 106. She/her. Head Crystal Elder. Mother Geshi’s second in-command. VERY stern. Austere, even snobbish. Protective of Mother Geshi and her position. Judgmental and excessively pragmatic (but can be reasoned with, usually only by Mother Geshi.) In charge of training Crystal Elder candidates.

  

Dereso - Aarakocra. 22. He/him. Twin to Izkerdala. Crystal Elder in training from the Caravan Kimik, hoping to join the Caravan Ogud after training. Timid, but with a defiant glare. Doesn’t speak verbally. Will fight you, then just as soon heal you with medical knowledge.

  

Izkerdala -  Aarakocra. 22. She/her. Twin to Dereso. Crystal Elder in training from the Caravan Kimik, hoping to remain in the Caravan Ani after training. Always has a mischievous glee about her. Into poisons and explosive alchemicals. Acts very serious around authority figures.
