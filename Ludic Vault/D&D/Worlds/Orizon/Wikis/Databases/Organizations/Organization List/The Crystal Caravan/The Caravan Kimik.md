The chief alchemical and healing knowledge/skill base for the Caravans.

Ligaulun - Tabaxi. 62. He/him. Leader of the Caravan Kimik. Fur constantly on end. Workspace constantly a mess. Wears giant spectacles. Speaks in a frantic and manic manner, even when not worried or anxious. Incredibly skilled and innovative alchemist. Jumpy. Don’t come near his workspace without letting him know. Th-th-there are secrets there! N-not to be released until the research is complete!! Complete!!!

  

Oisha - Orc. 51. She/her. Alchemical and medical safety expert. Drafting up a tome of rules and regulations for workplace safety. Will tell you what to do and how to do it with a swiftness--not out of meanness, but because she has simply studied this very hard and knows best practices (doesn’t mean it doesn’t come across as mean though). Collaborates with Ligaulun on alchemical research, and is also the only one keeping him and his workplace from falling completely into chaos. In a relationship with Poraka.

  

Poraka - Aarakocra. 54. She/her. A very skilled medical expert and apothecary of the Caravan Kimik. Knowledgeable in alchemical, herbal, and surgical healing. Mother to Izkerdala and Derso (currently away at The Caravan Ani for training). In a relationship with Oisha. Always has a song on her lips and in her heart. A bit of a “free spirit.” Prefers to take life day-by-day, moment-to-moment. Few inhibitions and shames. Very open-minded and very open to new experiences and new people.
