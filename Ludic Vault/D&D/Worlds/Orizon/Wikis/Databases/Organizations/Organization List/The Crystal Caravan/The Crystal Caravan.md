The Caravan Shadn (pronounced: sha-DEN) is one of several caravans in a broader culture of Pagano Banssaland nomadic caravaneers colloquially known as Crystal Caravans. These Crystal Caravans travel seasonally, with the main route going between Port Meeranu and the caves of the northern mountains. The Crystal Caravans find or are entrusted with dragon eggs and are responsible for giving them safe passage to Dragon Roost. Dragon eggs look like large crystals (which is what most people mistake the eggs for), thus the name. The knowledge of tracking down and caring for dragon eggs is a closely-guarded secret, and so the caravans are often wary of outsiders who seek to join them.

Locations (Starting from the Northernmost point of the main route)

Dragon Roost: The mountainous area to the North, once a gigantic supervolcano. The Caravans are one of the only peoples who know of a route through the Dracorofice Caverns and into the cauldron of Dragon Roost. These mountains are home to all kinds of dragonkin, from dragonborn to full blooded dragons. It is an incredibly dangerous area, but also incredibly sacred to the Caravans. The Caravans believe that Dragon Roost is where the gods went to die, not God Fall. These towering mountains are the true corpses of the dead gods, and as such are a sacred place to connect spiritually, as well as communally and materially with each other. These mountains and the connected Dracorofice Caverns are where The Caravans spend their winters and where they bring what eggs they could find so that they can hatch safely.

New Wynd: A resettlement of nearby Old Wynd. Filled with windmills kept and maintained by beastfolk. A fairly peaceful society, maintaining the windmills and building new ones, as a tradition. These windmills are simply windmills, with no apparent purpose, and the people of New Wynd have not told the Caravan why they are there and why exactly they maintain them. The Caravans believe these windmills are ill omens and bring bad luck, because they are not part of any ecosystem but are simply…*there*. They are like undead, kept alive past their time. The fact that the residents build new useless windmills and encroach upon the surrounding biomes is a point of much tension. There are those in the Caravans who believe the windmills themselves are living beings that exert mind control on people who stay nearby them for too long, and thus try to stay in New Wynd for only a short time. (This suspicion is only supported by the fact that no one can give them a straight answer as to the purpose of these windmills, and the fact that the designs of these windmills all derive from each other). There are others who suspect some dark magic or spirits are at play. Some believe Old Wynd could have been destroyed by a people who were made aware of the control that the windmills have, but that something must have survived that purge since New Wynd is now a thing… But what is commonly disliked is the pure waste of these windmills and the damage they cause, and the claim that the building and maintenance is done for some rigid and unchanging “tradition” that has outstayed its welcome. Yet New Wynd is a crucial stop on the caravan’s path, for trade of information and material goods, as well as a relatively safe place compared to the open road. (Also, Vincent was born when the Caravan was stopped in New Wynd). 

  

Beliefs and Ideology

The Caravans do not worship gods or deities, per se. There are no specific divine figures or pantheons. Rather, they find meaning in the sublime and sacred power of mountains, the Dragon Roost mountains being the most significant. They believe that mountains, and the things that are on, in, and around them, are the corpses, viscera, and remains of gods. To climb a mountain or enter its caverns is to be within a dead god itself. 

  

There are many ceremonies that involve climbing mountains. For example, to be initiated into “adulthood” or the “next stage” of life after childhood, the Caravan has these youths climb one of the peaks of Dragon Roost. This is done in the dead of winter, when all of the Caravans have convened in the north. It is a communal effort, focused on how the youths work together to survive rather than on individual merits.

  

The Caravans’ respect for the land extends into efforts to live symbiotically with the environment. Instead of completely changing the environment through intensive farming, mining, lumbering, etc. the Caravan teaches harvesting and propagating what is already there. For example, if there is a fruit tree somewhere, it’s not that they’ll only ever harvest from that one fruit tree and completely avoid farming. Instead, they will propagate and plant more of that fruit tree and other local edible/useable flora in the area, just being careful not to plant so much as to throw off the extant ecosystem. This is done not only out of respect for the land, but also out of necessity and practicality (knowing that a stable and diverse ecosystem is healthier for all involved, rather than a monocrop culture or destroying and irreversibly replacing ecosystems).

  

Surprisingly, most members of the Caravans are not particularly skilled in magic. It’s not that they lack the aptitude for it, but they believe that magic saps energy from the world around them (specifically, that the use of magic *must* have some sort of cost upon the Weave. After all, everything else in the world behave in such a way, so why should magic be any different?), and as such using it should be avoided as much as possible, only reserved for important occasions, ceremonial purposes, and emergencies. They are fine dealing with peoples who use magic, but within their own people they do not often allow the use of magic for everyday tasks or to replace mundane labors and effort. It is usually Elders who have more knowledge in magic. This is one of their most strictly enforced rules, but it is also being challenged in these times. Still, the Caravans try to use tools, mechanisms, and mundane means as much as possible, especially since Wild Magic Storms are rampant and random.
