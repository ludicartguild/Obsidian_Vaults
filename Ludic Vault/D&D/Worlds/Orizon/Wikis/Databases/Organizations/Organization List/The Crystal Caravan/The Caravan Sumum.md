Holds some of the most skilled magic users of all the caravans. Others are very wary of people from Sumum, since the practice of magic is perceived as mysterious and dangerous to many in the other Caravans.

Lihim- Firbolg. ???. They/them. Leader of the Caravan Sumum. A Crystal Elder, and currently the only Crystal Elder who specializes in magic. They are a fearsome Elder Druid (and some say they even practice necromancy or are even a warlock with a demonic pact. Though there is little proof beyond rumors). They wear heavy cloaks and a large hood, their face and features shrouded in shadow, with only the glow of their eyes shining through. No one knows what they truly look like, and no one dares try to find out. They rarely speak, and when they do it is in whispers to Tagasalin. People say that Lihim speaks a language that no one but their interpreter can understand.

  

Tagasalin - Orc. 33. He/him. Lihim’s “interpreter,” and Elder Wizard of the Caravan Sumum. He has a great interest in dreams, visions, and divination. Personally chosen to be interpreter by Lihim’s previous (now dead) interpreter. A very anxious man, constantly wringing his hands and wearing a nervous smile and knitted brow. For someone who studies dreams, he rarely gets any sleep himself. (Rumor has it that after some mysterious magical incident, he can only ever have terrible nightmares when he sleeps).

  

Guro - Genasi. 40?. They/them. The Elder Bard of The caravan Sumum. They can sing, dance, play nigh any musical instrument under the sun. Their mastery of the musical traditions and lyrical storytelling of Pagano Bansaland is second-to-none. When they are not performing or teaching, they have a grave and wistful look on their face. They sing haunting melodies at night when they are alone, melodies that evoke a nostalgia and yearning in any who hear it. Their song is said to ward off the dangers of the night, and keep the Caravan safe on its moonlit journeys.

  

Pagha - Tiefling. 21. He/him. Once training to be a warrior of the Caravan Ogud, he recently found that he has a lot of magical potential, causing chaos on a dragon egg retrieval mission during a magical storm where he unwittingly cast a firebolt cantrip (which triggered a wild magic surge). He was sent by Caravan Ogud’s leader (Elder Andirig) to train under The Caravan Sumum in the magical arts.
